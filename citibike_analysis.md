How does McDonald's locations impact Citi Bike usage?

There is no correlation between bike riders and McDonald's locations.  Biking activity for tourism attracts a small subset of tourists, those inclined to a more healthy lifestyle.  McDonald's is not the typical first choice for the healthy lifestyle.  Outdoor destinations and activities appear to have a positive correlation with bike tourism.

After considering that, and the "Doh!" moment, a few other factors were considered.

1. Climate.  How does this impact biking?  Would weather be significantly different in Des Moines?  In short, no.  One would be hard pressed to find two more identical climes.

2. How do the population demographics compare?  Des Moines is significantly smaller but is growing at 5 times the rate of New York's population.  The immediate opportunity may be smaller, but with the much, much higher growth rate of Des Moines, that makes this opportunity particularly intriquing for an investor.

3. Current utilization.  Where do New Yorkers and their tourists spend the most time on bike rentals?  There was a monstruous difference around parks and tourist sites like the Statue of Liberty.  What does Des Moines have that would appeal in a complementary fashion to spark bike rental interest?  It has hundreds of miles of prepared bike paths and shoulders ([Iowa DOT](https://iowadot.gov/iowabikes/bikemap/home.aspx)), plus no snarling New York attitudes nor their cabbies who use bike rentals as target practice!

### Conclusion
---
Since New York's Citi Bike rentals are driven by outdoor activities more than McDonald's.  The abundance of outdoor trails, parks and activities will generate a similar synergy in Des Moines, IA.  Climates are nearly identical and present no drag on growth in this investment opportunity.  Furthermore, the 5x growth rate of Des Moines when compared to New York City for 2018, is a continuation of a steady trend of higher growth in the midwest and out-migration from larger cities.  The opportunity is ripe and ready for the investor that wants to win with the next Citi Bike expansion!
